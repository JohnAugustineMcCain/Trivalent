## Overview

PEACE (Paraconsistent Epistemic And Contextual Evaluation) is a formal logical framework that enables safe reasoning in the presence of paradoxes, contradictions, and incomplete context. Unlike classical logic systems that fail catastrophically on paradoxes, PEACE preserves epistemic humility while maintaining rigorous mathematical foundations.

### Key Innovations

PEACE introduces **Context Completeness** (Cc âˆˆ [0,1]) - the first formal measure of how completely a claim specifies its evaluation context. This enables systematic detection of category errors and appropriate framework selection.

PEACE will assign a **Default Meta-Dialetheic Truth Value** (.5) to all perspective interpretations. When evaluating a claim, these perspectival truth values will be weighed against the claim (and, in the future, situational/user data). The idea is to make the claims dynamically update the perspectival truth value so that truth can be searched for according to perspective weighed against context created by thr claims. The cached values will then dynamically influence future 'decisions'. I need help making this dream a reality.

PEACE, because of its simplicity, epistemic guidance and contradiction-resilience, will be highly tolerant to self-modifying code implementations to optimize functionality and adapt to new problems without hallucination.

PEACE will also likely be highly reactive to mimicking personalities and be extremely modifiable as long as a dynamic perspective database is managed effectively.

## Core Features

- **Non-Explosive**: Handles contradictions without logical explosion
- **Context-Aware**: Formal methods for context completeness analysis  
- **Perspective-Based**: Multi-viewpoint evaluation with systematic fusion
- **Category Error Detection**: Automated identification of framework mismatches
- **Classical Preservation**: Maintains classical logic within appropriate domains
- **AI Safety Ready**: Designed for robust AI reasoning systems

## Truth Value System

V = {T, F, B}

- **T**: True only
- **F**: False only  
- **B**: Both true and false (meta-dialetheic default)

**Designated Values**: D = {T, B} (anything with true-content counts as "true enough")

## Major Applications

### Paradox Resolution
- **Liar Paradox**: "This statement is false" â†’ **B** (stable resolution)
- **Russell's Paradox**: Context-dependent evaluation prevents explosion
- **Sorites Paradox**: Vagueness handled through perspective multiplicity

### AI Safety
- **Contradiction-Resilient Training**: Safe learning from contradictory data
- **Uncertainty Preservation**: Maintains epistemic humility under ambiguity
- **Safe Self-Modification**: Systematic evaluation of system changes
- **Value Alignment**: Handles conflicting human preferences gracefully

### Mathematical Foundations
- **P vs NP Category Error**: Formal proof that classical NP strips decisive context
- **Goldbach Verification**: Lower bounds explain finite evidence limits
- **Computational Complexity**: Context completeness analysis of formal abstractions

## Research Impact

PEACE represents a paradigm shift from contradiction-avoidance to contradiction-guidance in formal reasoning. By providing the first systematic framework for context completeness analysis, it offers new tools for Logic, AI Safety, Mathematics, and Philosophy.

**About the Author**

I'm John A. McCain. I am not a professional programmer or AI researcher; I work at Walgreens. Three weeks ago I first learned about the P vs NP problem.

Using only my phone I began developing a reasoning framework that blends my own philosophical work with ideas from paraconsistent logic, AI safety, computational theory, and other sources.

I have not implemented real LLM adapters yet because I do not have access to large compute resources or APIs. My focus has been on creating the conceptual and logical foundation so others can plug in real models later.

This project is unusual. It is an AI safetyâ€“oriented reasoning system designed on a phone, built without formal coding training, and shaped entirely by philosophical insight combined with persistence and curiosity.
