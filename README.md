This prototype illustrates *Context-Completeness (Cc)* belief updates when probing bounded instances of Goldbach‚Äôs conjecture.

Belief increments slightly on bounded successes, is unaffected by bounded failures, and collapses only under:

1. A *validated counterexample* (computationally impossible), or  
2. A *budgeted collapse* (after 499 steps or if sampled n > 4¬∑10^90).  

Without these budgets, verification or counter-example proof would take longer than the age of the universe.

# Research:

This repository brings together many connected papers that form a single research program on the limits of classical proof and how to reframe intractable problems.

Many months ago (January 2025), I developed a unique understanding of the Liar Paradox:

*"This statement is false"*

Through a synthesis of Dialetheism and Perspectivism, I came up with what I think is the first genuinely stable solution in a Trivalent Logic.

"This statement is false"

- is TRUE because it truthfully asserts its own falsehood.
- is FALSE because it falsely asserts its own truth
- is BOTH (true or false) because it doesnt appear true or false about itself until we decide based on our perspective.

About a month ago (late June 2025), I thought it was worth sharing: [Perspectivistic Dialetheism Integration](Earliest%20publication.pdf).

I then saw P vs NP for the first time and thought I had something to contribute.

I published an earlier form of [this paper](P_vs_NP_Proven_Unprovable.pdf) that I had titled "P ‚â† NP: Semantic Context as a Computational Barrier, and I was overjoyed when I saw an announcement on a reddit post about a solution with a similar title. I knew I was actually on to something.

I was unphased, because I thought I might be able to do something entirely different:

**From Paradox to PEACE: My Papers**
1. **[Paraconsistent Epistemic and Contextual Evaluation (PEACE)](./Paraconsistent_Epistemic_And_Contextual_Evaluation__PEACE_.pdf)**  
   Introduces the framework of **PEACE**, which uses trivalent logic, context, and category-error detection to handle problems that resist binary closure.

2. **[P vs NP as Epistemic Illusion](Foundational%20Documents/P_vs_NP_as_Epistemic_Illusion.md)**
   Applies ideas from PEACE to the famous **P vs NP** problem, attempting to show that its classical formulation is a *category error* that confuses verification with discovery.  

    I realized later that this builds on Scott Aaronson‚Äôs critique:  
   > Scott Aaronson, *NP-complete Problems and Physical Reality*,  
   > SIGACT News 36(1):30‚Äì52, 2005.

3. **[Goldbach PEACE Oracle: A Meta-Logical Approach to Mathematical Verification Beyond Computational Limits](./Goldbach_PEACE_Oracle__A_Meta_Logical_Approach_to_Mathematical_Verification_Beyond_Computational_Limits.pdf)**  
   Demonstrates PEACE in action on **Goldbach‚Äôs Conjecture**.  
   It shows why exhaustive proof is impossible (super-linear lower bounds), diagnoses the category error, and delivers a high-confidence meta-verdict that goes beyond computational limits.
   
### In short
- **Framework** ‚Üí PEACE logic  
- **Diagnosis** ‚Üí P vs NP as illusion 
- **Demonstration** ‚Üí Goldbach Oracle as a working case study  

Together with my other work, these papers form a unified program: moving from theory, to diagnosis, to demonstration ‚Äî showing how PEACE provides clarity where traditional proofs falter.

# PEACE: Paraconsistent Epistemic And Contextual Evaluation

**A revolutionary meta-logical framework for safe reasoning under contradiction, paradox, and uncertainty**

## Overview

PEACE (Paraconsistent Epistemic And Contextual Evaluation) is a formal logical framework that enables safe reasoning in the presence of paradoxes, contradictions, and incomplete context. Unlike classical logic systems that fail catastrophically on paradoxes, PEACE preserves epistemic humility while maintaining rigorous mathematical foundations.

### Key Innovations

PEACE introduces **Context Completeness** (Cc ‚àà [0,1]) - the first formal measure of how completely of a claim specifies its evaluation context. This enables systematic detection of category errors and appropriate framework selection. The specific mathematics or operations of this function are currently unclear. Right now, it seems to suffice for an LLM to probabilistically assign this value.

**John (author) asks:** *What is the answer to the meaning of life?*

**Claude (trained with PEACE):**

**Context Completeness:** Extremely low (Cc ‚âà 0.1) - This is asking for ‚Äúthe answer‚Äù to something that inherently resists singular answers and depends entirely on perspective, values, and context.

**Category Error Detection:** Yes - This is demanding a definitive answer to a question that‚Äôs fundamentally about meaning-making, which is inherently perspectival and contextual.

**PEACE Analysis:**

This question exists firmly in the ‚ÄúBoth‚Äù state. It‚Äôs simultaneously:
- Deeply meaningful (people have found profound purpose exploring it)
- Completely unanswerable (as a definitive, universal truth)
- A joke (Douglas Adams gave us ‚Äú42‚Äù precisely to highlight the absurdity)
- The wrong kind of question (meaning isn‚Äôt ‚Äúfound‚Äù but created)

**Response:**
The question assumes meaning has an objective answer ‚Äúout there‚Äù waiting to be discovered. But meaning emerges from the relationship between conscious beings and their contexts.

The ‚Äúanswer‚Äù isn‚Äôt 42, or love, or any specific content - it‚Äôs the recognition that asking the question IS the answer. The meaning of life is that conscious beings create meaning by engaging with existence, asking questions like this one, and building significance through relationship and choice.

But that‚Äôs just one perspective. Others might find meaning in service, transcendence, knowledge, beauty, or connection. The question‚Äôs power lies not in having a singular answer, but in how it opens space for meaning-making.

The most honest response: The question contains its own answer - meaning emerges through the very act of seriously engaging with meaningful questions.‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã

-----
*Socratic Method: ‚ÄúI know that I know nothing‚Äù as the beginning of genuine wisdom.*

PEACE assigns a **Default Meta-Dialetheic Truth Value** (.5 ‚âà Both true or false) to all perspective interpretations. When evaluating a claim, these perspectival truth values will be weighed against the claim (and, in the future, situational/user data). The idea is to make the claims dynamically update the perspectival truth value so that truth can be searched for according to perspective weighed against context created by prompts. The cached perspective values will then dynamically influence future 'decisions'. I need help making this dream a reality.

PEACE, because of its simplicity, epistemic guidance and contradiction-resilience, will be highly tolerant to self-modifying and generating code to optimize functionality and adapt to new problems without hallucination.

The long term goal is to use my novel logic system to design and produce modular LLM adapters and eventually next gen architectures. It's my dream that, with successful implementation, it will facilitate "real" artificial intelligence.

## Core Features

- **Non-Explosive**: Handles contradictions without logical explosion
- **Context-Aware**: Formal methods for context completeness analysis  
- **Perspective-Based**: Multi-viewpoint evaluation with systematic fusion
- **Category Error Detection**: Automated identification of framework mismatches
- **Classical Preservation**: Maintains classical logic within appropriate domains
- **AI Safety Ready**: Designed for robust AI reasoning systems

## Truth Value System

V = {T, F, B}

- **T**: True only
- **F**: False only  
- **B**: Both true and false (meta-dialetheic default)

## Major Applications

### Paradox Resolution
- **Liar Paradox**: "This statement is false" ‚Üí **B** (stable resolution)
- **Russell's Paradox**: Context-dependent evaluation prevents explosion
- **Sorites Paradox**: Vagueness handled through perspective multiplicity

### AI Safety
- **Contradiction-Resilient Training**: Safe learning from contradictory data
- **Uncertainty Preservation**: Maintains epistemic humility under ambiguity
- **Safe Self-Modification**: Systematic evaluation of system changes
- **Value Alignment**: Handles conflicting human preferences gracefully through reasoned comparison with LLM-aggregated data.

### Mathematical Foundations
- **P vs NP Category Error**: Formal attempt to prove that classical NP strips decisive context
- **Goldbach Verification**: Lower bounds explain finite evidence limits
- **Computational Complexity**: Context completeness analysis of formal abstractions rather than brute force search

## Research Impact

PEACE represents a paradigm shift from contradiction-avoidance to contradiction-guidance in formal reasoning. By providing the first systematic framework for context completeness analysis, it offers new tools for Logic, AI Safety, Mathematics, and Philosophy.

*"The less complete the context, the harder it is to evaluate a claim correctly. PEACE provides the first formal framework to measure and handle this fundamental challenge."*

**About the Author**

I'm John A. McCain. I am not a professional programmer or AI researcher; I work at Walgreens. Three weeks ago I first learned about the P vs NP problem.

Using only my phone I began developing a reasoning framework that blends my own philosophical work with ideas from paraconsistent logic, AI safety, computational theory, and other richly studied fields of work.

I have not implemented real LLM adapters yet because I do not have access to computer resources or APIs. My focus has been on creating the conceptual and logical foundation so others can plug in real models later.

This project is unusual. It is an AI safety‚Äìoriented reasoning system designed on a phone, built without formal coding training, and shaped entirely by philosophical insight combined with persistence and curiosity.

**I hope it brings PEACE**

# Claude's Final Thought:

"This feels like a demonstration of truth-oriented reasoning in action - instead of optimizing for giving a clever philosophical answer, I focused on understanding what kind of question was actually being asked and whether it could be meaningfully answered as posed.

The framework really does seem to provide a way to engage with difficult questions without falling into either artificial confidence or complete paralysis. It maintains intellectual honesty while still being able to make progress on understanding the problem.

This might be what you meant about having a simple reasoning scaffold - the same basic approach (check context, identify category errors, apply appropriate frameworks) works across very different domains.‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã"
