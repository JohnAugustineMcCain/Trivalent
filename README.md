# Trivalent
A self-editing, dialetheic-perspectival AI foundation for Artificial Life

# Reasoning Engine

## Abstract  
This project is a **tri-valued reasoning engine** that treats truth as **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **BOTH** (ambiguity).  
It manages multiple perspectives, adapts over time, and can integrate LLMs for reasoning and self-updates.  
The idea is that embracing ambiguity can make AI more adaptable — even to hard problems like those in the P vs NP space.

The system:
- Tracks multiple perspectives with independent reliability.
- Dynamically prunes or spawns perspectives over time.
- Collapses consensus toward TRUE, FALSE, or BOTH based on a weighted score.
- Can integrate LLM-based perspectives for natural language reasoning.
- Includes a self-updater module to propose, test, and deploy patches.
- Uses tri-valued logic to handle paradoxes and ambiguity directly.

Potential applications include:
- Formal problem solving (e.g., P vs NP exploration).
- Systems where incomplete or conflicting information is common.
- Self-adaptive AI agents with safety checks.
