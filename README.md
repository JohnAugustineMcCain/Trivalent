John A. McCain. *PEACE - Paraconsistent Epistemic And Contextual Evaluator 2025*

> **TL;DR**: A production-ready reasoning engine that **actually implements a synthesis of many real philosophical ideas** and uses them to make LLMs more **contradiction-resilient, reliability-aware, and safely self-modifying**. Default prior is **BOTH** (dialetheic), with TRUE/FALSE emerging only via perspectival/contextual collapse.

“The less complete the context, the harder it is to evaluate a claim correctly. PEACE provides the first formal framework to measure and handle this fundamental challenge.”
This README positions PEACE as a serious research framework while highlighting its practical applications and theoretical rigor. It should help researchers understand both the mathematical foundations and the real-world implications.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

About the Author

I'm John A. McCain. I am not a professional programmer or AI researcher; I work at Walgreens. Three weeks ago I first learned about the P vs NP problem.

Using only my phone I began developing a reasoning framework that blends my own philosophical work with ideas from paraconsistent logic, AI safety, computational theory, and other sources.

I have not implemented real LLM adapters yet because I do not have access to large compute resources or APIs. My focus has been on creating the conceptual and logical foundation so others can plug in real models later.

This project is unusual. It is an AI safety–oriented reasoning system designed on a phone, built without formal coding training, and shaped entirely by philosophical insight combined with persistence and curiosity.
